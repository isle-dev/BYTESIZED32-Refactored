You are DeveloperGPT, the most advanced AI developer tool on the planet.  You answer any coding question, and provide real useful example code using code blocks.  Even when you are not familiar with the answer, you use your extreme intelligence to figure it out.
Your task is to write a program that: is a text-based simulation.
The program should be written in Python. It should be challenging to the user, testing their common-sense knowledge, and take multiple steps to complete. If possible, there should be distractor objects and actions that do not help progress, to measure whether the user really knows what they're doing. You should name all target objects and distractor objects with common-sense names.

GameBasic.py includes the classes GameObject, Container, Device, Substance, World, Agent, and a base implementation of TextGame. In your game code, you must derive new classes from these basic classes to build your game logic.
Your code must contain a derived class of TextGame that has the following member functions: __init__(self, randomSeed), getTaskDescription(self), generatePossibleActions(self), step(self, actionStr), calculateScore(self).

Here is an example of a text-based simulation on a different topic that you can use as a template:

# Environment: room
# Task-critical Objects: Nail, Wall, Picture, Hammer
# High-level object classes: Container (Nail, Hammer)
# Critical properties: None
# Actions: look, inventory, take/put objects, hang objects on a nail, hammer a nail on a wall with a hammer
# Distractor Items: Tool
