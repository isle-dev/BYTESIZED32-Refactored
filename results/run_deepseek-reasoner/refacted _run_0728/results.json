Instead, it implements specific actions like \"use thermometer on [object]\" which is explicitly handled in the code. Here's the evidence:\n\n1. In `generatePossibleActions()`, the only action containing \"use\" is:\n   ```python\n   if \"temperature\" in obj.properties:\n       self.addAction(\"use thermometer on \" + objReferent, [\"use thermometer on\", obj])\n   ```\n\n2. This maps to the dedicated handler method:\n   ```python\n   def actionUseThermometerOn(self, target):\n       # ... implementation ...\n   ```\n\n3. There are no other \"use\" actions defined in the action generation or handling logic. The specification's required \"use thermometer on object\" is implemented, but not as a generic \"use\" command."
