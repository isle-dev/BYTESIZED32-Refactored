However, the provided code **does not implement this distractor action**:\n\n1. The `generatePossibleActions` method includes an action labeled `\"drink {objName}\"`, but it maps to the `actionDrink` method.\n2. In `actionDrink`, the agent can drink milk directly or from the pot, but **this action never sets `gameOver` or `gameWon` to `True`**. Instead, it returns a narrative message (e.g., \"You drink the milk... the baby is still hungry\").  \n3. Critically, **drinking milk does not fail the task**\u2014it just wastes steps. The task can still be completed afterward by reheating new milk. The specification implies \"drink milk\" should be a true distractor (e.g., consuming the milk and forcing restart), but here it has no consequence on task success.\n\nThus, while a \"drink\" action exists, it lacks the **functional distraction** required by the spec (e.g., consuming milk irreversibly). The implementation treats it as a non-critical narrative action rather than a true distractor."

The specification explicitly marks `drink milk` as a distractor (i.e., an action that should *not* be part of the core solution). In a correctly implemented simulation, distractor actions should be either:  \n1. Not implemented at all, or  \n2. Implemented but functionally inert (e.g., returning an error message).  \n\nIn this code, `drink milk` is fully implemented (removes the milk from the game and provides feedback), which violates the specification. The only valid milk-related action should be `feed baby with milk`.  \n\n**Code Evidence:**  \nThe action is added in `generatePossibleActions()`:  \n```python\nself.addAction(f\"drink {milk.getReferents()[0]}\", [\"drink\", milk])\n```  \nAnd handled in `actionDrink()`:  \n```python\ndef actionDrink(self, milk):\n    milk.removeSelfFromContainer()\n    # ... returns feedback about drinking the milk\n```"
