Here's the Python code for the specified task of creating a micro-simulation that models how to add a certain amount of water into a pot using a measuring cup. The code includes the necessary classes and logic to implement the game mechanics as described.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Classes**:
   - **Sink**: A device that dispenses water when turned on.
   - **MeasuringCup**: A container that can hold a limited amount of water.
   - **Pot**: A container that can hold water, with a maximum volume.
   - **Water**: Represents the water substance.
   - **KitchenWorld**: Represents the environment where the game takes place.
   - **AddWaterGame**: The main game class that initializes the world and defines the game logic.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The player can take the measuring cup, put it in the sink, turn on the sink to fill the measuring cup, and then pour the water from the measuring cup into the pot.
   - The game tracks the volume of water in both the measuring cup and the pot.

3. **Actions**:
   - The player can perform actions like looking around, checking inventory, taking objects, turning on/off devices, and pouring water.

4. **Game Loop**:
   - The game runs in a loop, allowing the player to input commands and interact with the environment until the task is completed or the game is exited.

This code provides a complete simulation of the task specified, allowing for interaction and progression through the game mechanics.
