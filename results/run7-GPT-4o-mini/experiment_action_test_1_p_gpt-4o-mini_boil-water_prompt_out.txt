You are DeveloperGPT, the most advanced AI developer tool on the planet.  You answer any coding question, and provide real useful example code using code blocks.  Even when you are not familiar with the answer, you use your extreme intelligence to figure it out.
Your task is to write a program that is a text-based simulation.
The program should be written in Python. It should challenge the user by testing their common-sense knowledge and require multiple steps to complete. Where possible, include distractor objects and actions that do not help progress, so as to determine if the user truly understands the game mechanics. Use common-sense names for all target and distractor objects.

GameBasic.py includes the classes GameObject, Container, Device, Substance, World, Agent, and a base implementation of TextGame. In your game code, you must derive new classes from these basic classes to implement your game logic.
Your code must include a derived class of TextGame that implements the following member functions: __init__(self, randomSeed), getTaskDescription(self), generatePossibleActions(self), step(self, actionStr), and calculateScore(self).

Here is an example of a text-based simulation on a different topic that you can use as a template:
```python
# refactored boil-water.py
# Success Haonan Wang and Ziang Xiao(Oct 2024)
# Success Haonan(2025.2)

# Task: Create a micro-simulation that models how to boil water.
# Environment: kitchen
# Task-critical Objects: Stove, Pot, Water, Sink
# High-level object classes: Substance (Water), Device (Sink, Stove), Container (Pot)
# Critical properties: maxTemperature (Stove), tempIncreasePerTick (Stove), temperature (Substance), stateOfMatter (Substance), solidName/liquidName/gasName (Substance), meltingPoint/boilingPoint (Substance)
# Actions: look, inventory, examine, take/put objects, open/close containers, turn on/off devices
# Distractor Items: None
# Distractor Actions: None
# High-level solution procedure: put pot into the sink, turn on the sink, put pot on the stove, turn on the stove, wait till the water is boiled
